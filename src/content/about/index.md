I’m a data engineer passionate about applying mathematics and software principles to solve real-world problems using data.
As I mentioned on the homepage, I consider myself a **tool-agnostic** data engineer. I believe that theory and abstract science always take precedence—implementation is often the simpler part, especially with so many data solution companies creating tools with excellent user experiences to capture the community’s attention.

## Education  

I graduated in 2024 from Tanta University with a degree in electronics and electrical communication engineering. While studying, I was introduced to AI and Deep Learning through a mandatory university course. This course opened my eyes to the potential of data beyond traditional engineering disciplines.

My foundation in statistics, coupled with insights from this course, allowed me to understand how data could be leveraged to address challenges in engineering. For example, I explored how machine learning could enhance communication systems by reducing noise and improving signal quality.

Beyond academics, I actively participated in engineering-related student activities. These experiences helped me develop teamwork, leadership, and problem-solving skills in collaborative environments.

## Motivation  

It all began when I watched <a href= "https://youtu.be/7G_Kz5MOqps?si=lJQDIFXZboIh96pq" target="_blank"> this video </a> by accident. It opened my eyes to the power of data—not just in communication engineering but across countless fields.
